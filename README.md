# Calfiornia Housing Price Prediction (A complete analytical casestudy)
For a machine learning project we spend most of the time working with data by capturing, preparing and transforming it into promising features for machine learing alogithm and then we choose best algorithm, fit for the problem.
In this end to end machine learning projct, I went though a complete data science approach by,
1. Understanding the problem by looking a big picture view
2. Getting correct data
3. Explore data by vizualization and analysis and gain insight from the data
4. Prepare data and transform it for machine learning algorithm
5. Select model for training
6. Cross validation and fine tuning
